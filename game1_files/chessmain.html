<p><b><font color="#FF9C05"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Introduction</span></font></b></p>
<p>The game of chess is over 1300 years old and is one of the most popular games
in the world. It has received more total thought time than many great works of
art and literature. Like a great work of art, chess is a paradox on many levels.
It's easy to learn but can take a lifetime to
master. There are few games which can match its usefulness as a tool for
developing mental abilities, yet it's downright fun. <a href="http://intuitor.com/"> Intuitor.com</a> has provided
these online instructions to assist beginners and help promote the outstanding
game of chess.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chess is a two-person board game which simulates a battle between two
opposing armies. The board has sixty-four squares of alternating
colors. Each player has a set of sixteen pieces as shown below. One player will have
a set of dark or black pieces and the other a light or white set. These
symbolize opposing armies.</p>
<dl>
  <dd>8 Pawns</dd>
  <dd>2 Bishops</dd>
  <dd>2 Knights</dd>
  <dd>2 Rooks, or Castles</dd>
  <dd>1 Queen</dd>
  <dd>1 King</dd>
</dl>
<p><b><font color="#FF9C05">Moving and capturing:</font></b> White moves first followed by black. The players
continue taking turns using only their own pieces until the game ends. A turn
consists of a single act of either moving or capturing. When a piece is
moved, it is relocated in the center of a different square. A player can only
capture an opponent's piece, not their own.  When a chess piece is captured,
it is removed from the board and replaced by the attacking piece. Unlike checkers,
multiple captures are not allowed during the same move. <font color="#FFFFFF">Captures are also
optional. The exception is when the king is in jeopardy and the only way to save him is to capture a threatening piece.</font></p>
<br>
<p><b><font color="#FF9C05"><a name="board"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Board Setup</span></a></font></b></p>
<p>The playing board is the battlefield of the game. It's traditionally oriented
so that each player has a white square on the corner to his or her right. The
pieces are arranged on the board as shown. Note that the queen always is placed
on a square of her own color.</p>

<p align="left"><b><font color="#FF9C05"><a name="pieces"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Description of
Pieces</span></a></font></b></p>
<p><b><font color="#FF9C05">Pawn:</font></b> The pawn is considered the weakest piece on the board. It moves
laterally one square at a time, as shown in figure 2, with one exception. Each
pawn can be advanced by two squares the first time it's moved. Pawns can only
move in the forward direction. When they reach the last row, and can be moved no
further, they can be promoted to any type of piece on the board except for a
king. Generally they are promoted to a queen since this is the most powerful
piece on the board. Hence, a player can have more than one queen.</p>
<p align="center"><img border="0" src="./Pawn_Move.jpg" width="300" height="300"></p>
<center>figure 2. Pawn's Movement and Capture</center>

<p align="left">Pawns capture other pieces diagonally in the forward direction.
They are the only pieces which do not capture in the same direction in which they
move. </p>

<p align="left">&nbsp; </p>
<p><b><font color="#FF9C05">Bishop:</font></b> The bishop has the strength of about three pawns and moves
diagonally (see figure 3).
Unlike a pawn it can move backwards or forwards. It can also move more than one
square at a time as long as it moves in a straight line. In other words, a bishop
can move across the entire board. A bishop cannot jump over pieces and can also
never move to a different-colored square. Bishops capture by moving in their
normal manner to the square occupied by an opponent's piece and replacing it.</p>
<center><img border="0" src="./Bishop_Move.jpg" width="300" height="300"></center>
<p align="center">figure 3. Bishop's Move<font color="#FFFFFF">ment</font></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><font color="#FF9C05">Knight:</font></b> Like the bishop, knights have about the same strength as three pawns. Knights
are moved in a rather unique manner, one square diagonally and one square
laterally (see figure 3). They can move forwards or backwards and are the only
pieces which can jump over other pieces (see figure 4). Knights capture by
moving in their normal manner to a square occupied by an opponent's piece and
replacing it.</p>
<center><img border="0" src="./Knight_Move.jpg" width="302" height="303"></center>
<p align="center">figure 4. Knight's Movement</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><font color="#FF9C05">Rook:</font></b> The rook, or castle, has the strength of about five pawns. Rooks
are moved forwards or sideways in a lateral manner as shown in figure 5. They can
move backwards and forwards one or more squares at a time. In a given move a
castle can only move in one direction along a straight line. To capture a piece,
castles are moved in their normal manner to the occupied square where they
replace the captured piece.</p>
<center><img border="0" src="./Rook_Move.jpg" width="299" height="300"></center>
<p align="center">figure 5. Rook's Movement</p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><font color="#FF9C05">Queen:</font></b> The queen is the most powerful piece on the board and is the
equivalent of about nine pawns. A queen can move diagonally like a bishop or
laterally like a castle (see figure 6). Like the bishop and the castle, a queen
cannot turn corners in a single move. It captures in the same manner as either a castle or a
<font color="#FFFFFF"> bishop</font>.</p>
<center><img border="0" src="./Queen_Move.jpg" width="300" height="300"></center>
<p align="center">figure 6. Queen's Movement</p>

<p><b><font color="#FF9C05">King:</font></b> A king is only slightly more powerful than a pawn but is
nevertheless the most important piece on the board. While the king can move
backwards or forwards, either laterally or diagonally just like a queen, it can
only do so one square at a time (see figure 7). A king cannot move to a square
where it would be in danger of being captured. A king can capture a piece on any
square where it can legally move.</p>
<center><img border="0" src="./King_Move.jpg" width="299" height="300"></center>
<p align="center">figure 7. King's Movement</p>
<br><br>
<p align="left"><b><font color="#FF9C05"><a name="specialmoves"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Special Moves</span></a></font></b></p>

<p><font color="#FF9C05"><b>Castling:</b></font> While the rook is the second most powerful piece on the board, it
starts the game in a poor position to use its power. Also the king, the
most important piece on the board, is located in a position which becomes
increasingly vulnerable as the game develops. To overcome these problems
castling was invented. It is the only time more than one piece can be moved at a
time. In castling <font color="#FFFFFF">the</font> king is moved two squares toward
<font color="#FFFFFF"> one of his rooks an</font>d then the rook
is placed on the opposite side of the king. <font color="#FFFFFF"> For example</font>, if the king moves
two squares to the right, the rook is placed one square to the left of the king. This usually places the king in a safer position behind a
wall of pawns. It also places the rook in a more powerful position near the
center of the board. A king can castle to either side but can only castle once and cannot jump over pieces in the way.</p>
<p>Castling can only occur under the following conditions:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>It hasn't been previously done</li>
    <li>There are no pieces in the way</li>
    <li>Neither the rook nor the king have been moved</li>
    <li>None of the squares the king must pass through are guarded by the opponent's
pieces. In other words, if moving the king one square instead of two squares
would place the king in check then castling is prohibited.</li>
    <li>The king is not in check.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Castling is a very powerful move and so it's generally a good idea to castle
fairly early in the game. Otherwise an opponent can force the king to move,
making castling impossible. Castling early also makes the power of the rooks
more useful.</p>

<p><b><font color="#FF9C05">En passant:</font></b> This is a form of capturing done by a pawn to a pawn and
is possibly the least understood rule in chess. Many people play for their
entire lives and never use it. Needless to say, if you're a beginner it's best to learn this rule after you have played a few games.</p>

<p>En passant was created so that pawns cannot evade capture by an opponent's
pawns by moving two squares on their first move. If this happens, then the
opponent's pawn can capture the pawn moving two squares just as though it had moved only one. An opponent can choose not to exercise the
right to capture a piece by en passant. However, the right must be used
immediately following the opportunity or it is lost.</p>

<br><br>

<p><b><font color="#FF9C05"><a name="winning"><span style="text-transform: uppercase">Objective for Winning</span></a></font></b></p>

<p><font color="#FF9C05"><b>Check:</b></font> Threatening a king with capture is
treated differently from an ordinary piece. The king is not only royal but the
objective of the entire game. A player declares "check" when he moves
in a manner which threatens an opponent's king with capture. However, the term
is only used if&nbsp; the king has a means of escape. The opponent&nbsp; must&nbsp;
get the king
out of check immediately. This can be done in one of three ways: 1) Move the king. 2)
Capture the attacking piece. 3) Move a piece so that it blocks the attack. A
king cannot castle if it is in check.</p>

<p><font color="#FF9C05"><b>Checkmate:</b></font> The game is won when an opponent's king is inescapably placed in a position
where it would be captured on the next turn. Actually capturing the king and
removing it from the board like a common piece would have been unthinkable when
chess was invented, and so this is not done. Instead the winner says the word
checkmate and the game ends.</p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">Sometimes a king is placed in check several times and
never checkmated. Other times a king is placed directly in checkmate. There is
no rule saying a king must be placed in check before it is placed in checkmate
and there is no limit on the number of times a king can be placed in check.</font></p>

<p><font color="#FFFFFF">If a player foolishly exposes his king to check, he is allowed to take the
move back. Obviously there is no glory in winning by breaking rules and the
rules say one cannot move in a way which exposes one's king to check. Likewise,
if there is a means of escape and a player foolishly doesn't take it, the move
must be replayed. On the other hand, if a player assumes the game is hopelessly
lost and resigns, he or she automatically loses even if later analysis indicates
that the situation was not hopeless. Resigning a game is risky but is the sign
of an experienced player. Resigning is a way to save face by not pointlessly
prolonging the game.</font></p>

<p>A game can end in a draw in four different ways:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li><b><font color="#FF9C05">Stalemate:</font></b> This means there is no legal move an opponent can
      make when it is his or her turn to move. This often occurs when a king is
      trapped in a position where its only move would be to move into check</li>
    <li><b><font color="#FF9C05">The fifty-move rule:</font></b> If a piece has not been captured or a pawn
      moved in fifty moves then a player can declare a draw on his or her
      turn.</li>
    <li><b><font color="#FF9C05">Both sides agree to a draw.</font></b></li>
    <li><b><font color="#FF9C05">Neither side has enough pieces left to setup a checkmate.</font></b></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The stalemate is the most disconcerting of the ways to draw because it can snatch
victory from an opponent with clearly superior numbers who by all rights should
win.</p>
